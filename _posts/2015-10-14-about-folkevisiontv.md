# About Folkevision.tv

We started a game where we point to a country on our [beach-ball globe][0], then search YouTube for a folk music or dance video from that region.

We're not too picky about the genre. It's just an interesting way to see how people represent the place that they are from.

The goal is to find videos from every country.

Eventually it would be cool to have an embedded map to explore.
